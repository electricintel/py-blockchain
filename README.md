  This repository is the Tiniest Blockchain Development with Python. I referenced [Gerald Nash's Medium](https://medium.com/crypto-currently/lets-build-the-tiniest-blockchain-e70965a248b).

  There are two parts.

  * [Part 1](https://medium.com/crypto-currently/lets-build-the-tiniest-blockchain-e70965a248b) : Let’s Build the Tiniest Blockchain In Less Than 50 Lines of Python
  * [Part 2](https://medium.com/crypto-currently/lets-make-the-tiniest-blockchain-bigger-ac360a328f4d) : Let’s Make the Tiniest Blockchain Bigger With More Lines of Python
